    <h1>RowChat Terms of Service</h1>
    
    <div class="meta">
      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 18, 2025<br>
      <strong>Support Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:witchnock@gmail.com">witchnock@gmail.com</a><br>
      <strong>Version:</strong> 1.0
    </div>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and RowChat ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing the RowChat website, creating an account, or participating in any chat room, you agree to be bound by these Terms in their entirety.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Eligibility and Age Requirements</h2>
      <p><strong>Minimum Age:</strong> You must be at least 13 years of age to use RowChat. Users between 13-17 require verifiable parental consent. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you meet these age requirements.</p>
      <p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> You must comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Account Security and Responsibility</h2>
      <p>To access certain features of RowChat, you must create an account. You are solely responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Credential Integrity:</strong> Maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account details.</li>
        <li><strong>Vicarious Liability:</strong> All activities that occur under your username. If your account is used by a third party to violate these terms, your account remains subject to termination.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Providing truthful and updated information. Impersonation of RowChat staff or other users is strictly prohibited and results in an immediate permanent ban.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Sharing:</strong> You may not share, sell, or transfer your account to any other person.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. User-Created Rooms & Administrative Authority</h2>
      <p>RowChat allows users to create and manage their own chat environments ("User Rooms").</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Host Responsibility:</strong> If you create a room, you are the "Room Host." You are responsible for the conduct within that room. While RowChat provides moderation tools, the Host must ensure their room does not become a hub for illegal activity or targeted harassment.</li>
        <li><strong>No Sovereignty:</strong> User Rooms are not private legal entities. RowChat administrators reserve the right to enter, monitor, or shut down any User Room at any time, without notice, if we believe it violates our Global Conduct Standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Public vs. Private:</strong> Regardless of whether a room is marked "Private," all content is subject to our automated safety filters and global reporting system.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Global Conduct Standards (Zero-Tolerance Policy)</h2>
      <p>To close potential loopholes, we define prohibited conduct broadly. Prohibited actions include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hate Speech and Slurs:</strong> The use of epithets, slurs, or coded language intended to demean individuals based on race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. This applies even if the language is intended as "satire" or "irony."</li>
        <li><strong>Harassment and Doxing:</strong> Engaging in targeted attacks, or the sharing of private, identifying information (PII) of any person (including real names, addresses, or phone numbers) without their explicit consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploitative Content:</strong> Any content that depicts, encourages, or links to the exploitation of minors or non-consensual sexual content is strictly illegal and will be reported to the relevant authorities (e.g., NCMEC).</li>
        <li><strong>Spam and Advertising:</strong> Unsolicited commercial messages, repetitive messages, or promotion of external services without permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Pretending to be someone else, including RowChat staff, other users, or public figures.</li>
        <li><strong>Circumvention:</strong> Attempting to bypass word filters, automated bans, or IP blocks through "leetspeak," proxy servers, VPNs (used for the purpose of ban evasion), or alternative accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Malicious Software:</strong> Distributing links to malware, viruses, or phishing sites designed to compromise the security of other users.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Use:</strong> Using bots, scripts, or automated tools to interact with RowChat without explicit permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Harm Content:</strong> Encouraging, glorifying, or providing instructions for self-harm or suicide.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> You may appeal a ban by contacting witchnock@gmail.com with your username and reason for appeal.</li>
      </ul>
